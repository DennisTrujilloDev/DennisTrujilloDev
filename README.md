- 👋 Hi, I’m @DennisTrujilloDev
- 👀 I’m interested in geopolitics, the future of artificial intelligence, maps, and skylines (favorites: Shanghai & NYC!). 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript (LOVIN' it — was a total algebra nerd in high school) and the study methods that work best for me. Additionally, I am always looking to improve my French-language and yoga skills. 
- Interesting facts about me: I practiced Capoeira, a Brazilian martial art disguised as a dance, for several years. I have lived in four of the seven continents that make up our world. 
- My hobbies include: swimming and snorkeling, biking, (spoken and programming) languages. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects. Any suggestions? 
- 📫 How to reach me: Email (dennis.joel.trujillo@gmail.com), Twitter (https://twitter.com/DennisJoelTruj2), or LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/dennis-trujillo/)
