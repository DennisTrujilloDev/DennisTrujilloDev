- 👋 Hi, I’m @DennisTrujilloDev
- 👀 I’m interested in geopolitics, the future of artificial intelligence, spoken and programming languages, maps, and skylines (favorites: Shanghai & NYC!). 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript (LOVIN' it — was a total algebra nerd in high school) and the study methods that work best for me. Additionally, I am always looking to improve my French-language and yoga skills.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects. Any suggestions? 
- 📫 How to reach me: Email (dennis.joel.trujillo@gmail.com), Twitter (https://twitter.com/DennisJoelTruj2), or LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/dennis-trujillo/)
